# CMPG-323-Overview---38082918
Good day lecturer/assistant

Welcome to my Overview repository. This respository is set up to document and lay out the overview of my CMPG 323 project.
The project will be delivered in incremental tasks/subprojects of five. Thus you are going to ultimately have access to five
projects and/or repositories by the end of this semester. Below is a breakdown of what each increment/deliverable consists of:

Project 1: Agile

Project 2: Web API

Project 3: Patterns & Standards

Project 4: RPA & Testing

Project 5: Reporting & Monitoring

### BRANCHING STRATEGIES TO BE USED WITHIN EACH PROJECT //heading

What is a branch: Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained seperate area.
A default branch exists for every new repository and you can pull a sub branch from this main branch so you can modify your project without affecting 
the progress already saved in the main branch. Then if you are satisfied with with your modifications, you push back the secondary branch to the main branch.
